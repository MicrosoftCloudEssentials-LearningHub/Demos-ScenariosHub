### Model Catalog 

> The Model Catalog in Azure AI Studio is a `central hub where you can discover, evaluate, and deploy a wide range of AI models`. It includes models from various providers such as Azure OpenAI Service, Mistral, Meta, Cohere, NVIDIA, and Hugging Face, as well as models trained by Microsoft.

</p>

The model catalog offers two distinct `ways to deploy models` for your use:
- Managed Compute
- Serverless API.

| **Type of Model**            | **Description**                                                                 | **Examples**                          |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Curated by Azure AI          | Popular non-Microsoft models optimized for Azure AI platform.                   | Models from Hugging Face, NVIDIA      |
| Azure OpenAI Models          | Exclusive models available through Azure OpenAI Service, supported by Microsoft.| GPT-4, Codex, DALL-E                  |
| Open Models from Hugging Face| Hundreds of models from the Hugging Face hub, available for real-time inference. | Various NLP and vision models         |

### Model Benchmarks

> Model Benchmarks in Azure AI Studio is a feature that allows users to compare the performance of various AI models. This tool helps you make informed decisions about which model best suits your specific task by providing a comprehensive comparison of benchmarking metrics.

| Key Aspect                  | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Comparison of Models        | Compare LLMs and SLMs based on metrics like accuracy, coherence, fluency, and GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) similarity this metric is particularly useful when comparing the performance of different language models. |
| Quality and Embeddings Benchmarks | Evaluate models based on quality and embeddings benchmarks.              |
| Efficiency                  | Reduce development time and infrastructure costs by identifying the most suitable model quickly. |
| User-Friendly               | Accessible within the same environment where you build, train, and deploy AI solutions. |

### Azure AI Services

> Azure AI Services is a comprehensive suite of AI tools and services provided by Microsoft to help developers and organizations build intelligent applications.

### Deployments 

> Types of deployments available in Azure AI Studio:

| **Deployment Method**       | **Description**                                                                 | **Billing Model**                      |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Serverless API              | Deploy models as serverless APIs, accessible via endpoints without managing infrastructure. | Pay-as-you-go (per token/request)      |
| Models as a Service (MaaS)  | Managed service where models are hosted and maintained by Azure.                | Pay-as-you-go (per token)              |
| Models as a Platform (MaaP) | Deploy models on dedicated virtual machines (VMs) for more control over resources. | Billed as VMs per-hour                 |
| Flows and Web Applications  | Deploy models as part of larger workflows or web applications.                  | Varies based on usage                  |
| Managed Compute             | Use Azure's managed compute resources to deploy and run models.                 | Combination of compute and storage costs|
