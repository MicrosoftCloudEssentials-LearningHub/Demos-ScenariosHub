  | **Feature** | **Azure AI Studio** | **Azure OpenAI** |
  |-------------|----------------------|------------------|
  | **Scope** | Comprehensive platform for building, testing, and deploying generative AI applications | Specific service providing access to OpenAI's models |
  | **Model Catalog** | Includes models from OpenAI, Hugging Face, Meta, and more | Focuses on OpenAI models like GPT-4, Codex, and DALL-E |
  | **Collaboration** | Provides a collaborative environment with shared files and connections to pretrained models, data, and compute resources | Offers a playground for experimenting with OpenAI models |
  | **Tools** | Supports LLMOps for generative AI solutions, including evaluation, connection management, and flow logic | Allows users to manage deployments and models directly through the Azure OpenAI Studio |
  | **Use Cases** | Suitable for a wide range of AI applications, including text, image, and document processing | Primarily for text generation, summarization, translation, and question answering |


### Model Catalog 

> The Model Catalog in Azure AI Studio is a `central hub where you can discover, evaluate, and deploy a wide range of AI models`. It includes models from various providers such as Azure OpenAI Service, Mistral, Meta, Cohere, NVIDIA, and Hugging Face, as well as models trained by Microsoft.

</p>

The model catalog offers two distinct `ways to deploy models` for your use:
- Managed Compute
- Serverless API.

#### Deployments 

> Types of deployments available in Azure AI Studio:

| **Deployment Method**       | **Description**                                                                 | **Billing Model**                      |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Serverless API              | Deploy models as serverless APIs, accessible via endpoints without managing infrastructure. | Pay-as-you-go (per token/request)      |
| Models as a Service (MaaS)  | Managed service where models are hosted and maintained by Azure.                | Pay-as-you-go (per token)              |
| Models as a Platform (MaaP) | Deploy models on dedicated virtual machines (VMs) for more control over resources. | Billed as VMs per-hour                 |
| Flows and Web Applications  | Deploy models as part of larger workflows or web applications.                  | Varies based on usage                  |
| Managed Compute             | Use Azure's managed compute resources to deploy and run models.                 | Combination of compute and storage costs|
