> How to parse PDFs from an Azure Storage Account, process them using Azure Document Intelligence, and store the results in Cosmos DB. <br/> <br/>
> 1. Upload your PDFs to an Azure Blob Storage container. <br/>
> 2. An Azure Function is triggered by the upload, which calls the Azure Document Intelligence API to analyze the PDFs.  <br/>
> 3. The extracted data is parsed and subsequently stored in a Cosmos DB database, ensuring a seamless and automated workflow from document upload to data storage.

## Overview 

> `Azure Document Intelligence`, formerly known as **Form Recognizer**, is a powerful AI service that extracts structured data from documents. It `uses machine learning models to analyze and process various types of documents, such as invoices, receipts, business cards`, and more.

| Key Features | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **Prebuilt Models** | - **Invoice Model**: Extracts fields like invoice ID, date, vendor information, line items, totals, and more.<br/>- **Receipt Model**: Extracts merchant name, transaction date, total amount, and line items.<br/>- **Business Card Model**: Extracts contact information such as name, company, phone number, and email. |
| **Custom Models** | - **Training**: You can train custom models using labeled data. This involves uploading a set of documents and manually labeling the fields you want to extract.<br/>- **Model Management**: Manage versions of your custom models, retrain them with new data, and evaluate their performance. |
| **APIs and SDKs** | - **REST API**: Provides endpoints for analyzing documents, managing models, and retrieving results.<br/>- **SDKs**: Available in multiple languages (e.g., Python, C#, JavaScript) to simplify integration into your applications. |

## Step 1: Set Up Your Azure Environment

> An Azure `Resource Group` is a `container that holds related resources for an Azure solution`.
> It can include all the resources for the solution or only those you want to manage as a group.
> Typically, resources that share the same lifecycle are added to the same resource group, allowing for easier deployment, updating, and deletion as a unit.
> Resource groups also store metadata about the resources, and you can apply access control, locks, and tags to them for better management and organization.

1. **Create an Azure Account**: If you don't have one, sign up for an Azure account.
2. **Create a Resource Group**:
   - Go to the Azure portal.
   - Navigate to **Resource groups**.
   - Click **+ Create**.

   - Enter the Resource Group name (e.g., `RGContosoAIDoc`) and select a region (e.g., `East US 2`). You can add tags if needed.
   - Click **Review + create** and then **Create**.

## Step 2: Set Up Azure Blob Storage for PDF Ingestion

> An `Azure Storage Account` provides a `unique namespace in Azure for your data, allowing you to store and manage various types of data such as blobs, files, queues, and tables`. It serves as the foundation for all Azure Storage services, ensuring high availability, scalability, and security for your data. <br/> <br/>
> A `Blob Container` is a `logical grouping of blobs within an Azure Storage Account, similar to a directory in a file system`. Containers help organize and manage blobs, which can be any type of unstructured data like text or binary data. Each container can store an unlimited number of blobs, and you must create a container before uploading any blobs.

1. **Create a Storage Account**:
   - In the Azure portal, navigate to your **Resource Group**.
   - Click **+ Create**.

   - Search for `Storage Account`.
  
       <img width="550" alt="image" src="">

   - Select the Resource Group you created.
   - Enter a Storage Account name (e.g., `invoicecontosostorage`).
   - Choose the region and performance options, and click `Next` to continue.

   - If you need to modify anything related to `Security, Access protocols, Blob Storage Tier`, you can do that in the `Advanced` tab.

   - Regarding `Networking`, this example will cover `Public access` configuration. However, please ensure you review your privacy requirements and adjust network and access settings as necessary for your specific case.

   - Click **Review + create** and then **Create**. Once is done, you'll be able to see it in your Resource Group.

2. **Create a Blob Container**:
   - Go to your Storage Account.
   - Under **Data storage**, select **Containers**.
   - Click **+ Container**.
   - Enter a name for the container (e.g., `pdfinvoices`) and set the public access level to **Private**.
   - Click **Create**.
