It also provided several new features. <br/> <br/> Here are some of the key features of the Azure AI Language service: <br/> 1. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: This preconfigured feature categorized entities (words or phrases) in unstructured text across several predefined category groups. <br/> 2. **Personally Identifying (PII) and Health (PHI) Information Detection**: This preconfigured feature identified, categorized, and redacted sensitive information in both unstructured text documents, and conversation transcripts. <br/> 3. **Language Detection**: This preconfigured feature detected the language a document was written in, and returned a language code for a wide range of languages, variants, dialects, and some regional/cultural languages. <br/> 4. **Sentiment Analysis and Opinion Mining**: These preconfigured features helped find out what people think of a brand or topic by mining text for clues about positive or negative sentiment, and could associate them with specific aspects of the text. <br/> 5. **Summarization**: This preconfigured feature used extractive text summarization to produce a summary of documents and conversation transcriptions. <br/> <br/> However, please note that as of July 2023, Azure AI services encompassed all of what were previously known as Cognitive Services and Azure Applied AI Services.

| AI + APIs | AI Service | Metrics Advisors  $${\color{red}Retired}$$ | Azure AI Metrics Advisor was a part of Azure AI services that used AI to perform data monitoring and anomaly detection in time series data. The service automated the process of applying models to your data, and provided a set of APIs and a web-based workspace for data ingestion, anomaly detection, and diagnostics. Developers could build AIOps, predictive maintenance, and business monitor applications on top of the service. <br/> <br/> Here are some of the key features of the Azure AI Metrics Advisor service: <br/> 1. **Connect to a variety of data sources**: Metrics Advisor could connect to, and ingest multi-dimensional metric data from many data stores, including SQL Server, Azure Blob Storage, MongoDB and more. <br/> 2. **Easy-to-use and customizable anomaly detection**: Metrics Advisor automatically selected the best model for your data, without needing to know any machine learning. It could automatically monitor every time series within multi-dimensional metrics. Users could use parameter tuning and interactive feedback to customize the model applied on their data, and future anomaly detection results. <br/> 3. **Real-time notification through multiple channels**: Whenever anomalies were detected, Metrics Advisor was able to send real time notification through multiple channels using hooks, such as email hooks, web hooks, Teams hooks and Azure DevOps hooks. Flexible alert configuration let users customize when and where to send a notification. <br/> 4. **Smart diagnostic insights by analyzing anomalies**: Metrics Advisor combined anomalies detected on the same multi-dimensional metric into a diagnostic tree to help users analyze root cause into specific dimension. <br/> <br/> However, please note that starting from the 20th of September, 2023, creation of new Metrics Advisor resources was discontinued, and the Metrics Advisor service was retired on the 1st of October, 2026.

| AI + APIs | AI Service | Personalizers  $${\color{red}Retired}$$ | Azure AI Personalizer was an AI service provided by Microsoft Azure. It used reinforcement learning to help applications make smarter decisions at scale. Personalizer processed information about the state of your application, scenario, and/or users (contexts), and a set of possible decisions and related attributes (actions) to determine the best decision to make. <br/> <br/> Here are some of the key features of the Azure AI Personalizer service: <br/> - Real-time Learning: Personalizer could improve over time based on user behavior, and discover what maximizes results to stay on top of changing trends. <br/> - Quick Integration: Personalizer could be embedded by adding two lines of code. It worked with your data in any form. <br/> - Apprentice Mode: When turned on, Personalizer learned alongside your existing solution without being exposed to users until it met your performance threshold. <br/> - Evaluation: Users could interpret and evaluate Personalizer through the interface. <br/> <br/> However, please note that starting from the 0th of September, 03, creation of new Personalizer resources was discontinued, and the Personalizer service was retired on the st of October, 06.
