Find below strategies to enhance process efficiency:

- **Contextual Memory**: Implement a server-side system that retains conversation context. This allows for sending only new user utterances to the model, with the server adding necessary context before the API call.
- **Prompt Compression**: Apply techniques to shorten the prompt by removing non-essential words, simplifying sentences, and concentrating on key context and instructions.
- **Batch Processing**: For multiple queries, group them into a single API call to decrease request numbers and boost efficiency.
- **Parameterization**: Use a parameterized format for prompts to allow dynamic input substitution, reducing prompt size while keeping it flexible.
- **Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess input data to eliminate unnecessary whitespace, punctuation, and formatting issues, optimizing prompt processing efficiency.

These approaches can significantly reduce computational demands and enhance model efficiency in chatbot applications.
