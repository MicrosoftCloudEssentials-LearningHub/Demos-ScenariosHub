## Overview 

Explanation of Power BI SKUs:

- **Power BI SKUs** are applicable to certain licenses because they provide additional resources specifically for Power BI workloads. These SKUs (EM, A, and P series) are designed to support different levels of Power BI usage:
  - **EM SKUs** (Embedded) are for embedding Power BI content in applications.
  - **A SKUs** (Azure) are for Azure-based Power BI services.
  - **P SKUs** (Premium) are for high-end, enterprise-level Power BI capabilities.
- **Not applicable** for smaller licenses (F2, F4) because these licenses are intended for basic data integration and visualization without the need for extensive Power BI resources. These smaller licenses are more suited for individual users or small teams who do not require the advanced features and computational power provided by Power BI SKUs.

Detailed Features by License:

> [Azure Pricing Calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/calculator/?msockid=38ec3806873362243e122ce086486339) will calculate storage costs if you exceed the included limit for your selected SKU. If your usage stays within the included storage capacity, you shouldnâ€™t see additional charges for storage. <br/> <br/> 
> The included storage in Microsoft Fabric primarily applies to **mirroring** across all F SKUs. This means that the free storage provided (e.g., 64 TB for F64) is specifically allocated for creating mirrored copies of your data to ensure redundancy and high availability. <br/> <br/>
> For other types of storage, such as general data storage or storage used by Data Factory and AI capabilities, you will be billed if you exceed the included storage or if compute capacity is paused.This applies to all F SKUs, from F2 to F2048.

> [!NOTE]
> - `Capacity Units (CU)`: Measure of compute power within a SKU. Higher CUs provide more computational capacity. <br/>
> - `Power BI SKU`: Different SKUs (A, EM, P, F) cater to various needs from individual users to large enterprises. <br/>
> - `Power BI v-cores`: Virtual cores dedicated to Power BI operations, ensuring consistent performance. <br/>
> - `Included Storage`: Amount of storage included with each license. Additional storage is billed separately. <br/>
> - `Max Concurrent Users`: The maximum number of users that can simultaneously access the service. <br/>
> - `Billing for Storage`: Storage is billed when usage exceeds included storage or if compute capacity is paused.
> - `Features`: Range from basic data integration to advanced AI and ML capabilities, including real-time analytics, deep learning models, and natural language processing. <br/>
