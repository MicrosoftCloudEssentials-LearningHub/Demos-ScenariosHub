     )
     display(transformer.transform(df))
     ```

### Step 5: Using LangChain for Large Scale Literature Review
1. **Define Functions for Content Extraction and Prompt Generation**:
   - Extract content from PDFs linked in arXiv papers and generate prompts for extracting specific information:
     ```python
     from langchain.document_loaders import OnlinePDFLoader

     def paper_content_extraction(inputs: dict) -> dict:
         arxiv_link = inputs["arxiv_link"]
         loader = OnlinePDFLoader(arxiv_link)
         pages = loader.load_and_split()
         return {"paper_content": pages[0].page_content + pages[1].page_content}

     def prompt_generation(inputs: dict) -> dict:
         output = inputs["Output"]
         prompt = (
             "find the paper title, author, summary in the paper description below, output them. "
             "After that, Use websearch to find out 3 recent papers of the first author in the author section below "
             "(first author is the first name separated by comma) and list the paper titles in bullet points: "
             "<Paper Description Start>\n" + output + "<Paper Description End>."
         )
         return {"prompt": prompt}
     ```

2. **Create a Sequential Chain for Information Extraction**:
   - Set up a chain to extract structured information from an arXiv link:
     ```python
     from langchain.chains import TransformChain, SimpleSequentialChain

     paper_content_extraction_chain = TransformChain(
         input_variables=["arxiv_link"],
         output_variables=["paper_content"],
         transform=paper_content_extraction,
         verbose=False,
     )

     paper_summarizer_template = """
     You are a paper summarizer, given the paper content, it is your job to summarize the paper into a short summary, 
     and extract authors and paper title from the paper content.
     """
     ```

### Step 6: Machine Learning Integration with Microsoft Fabric
1. **Train and Register Machine Learning Models**:
   - Use Microsoft Fabric's native integration with the MLflow framework to log the trained machine learning models, the used hyperparameters, and evaluation metrics:
     ```python
     import mlflow
     from mlflow.models import infer_signature
     from sklearn.datasets import make_regression
     from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

     # Generate synthetic regression data
     X, y = make_regression(n_features=4, n_informative=2, random_state=0, shuffle=False)

     # Model parameters
     params = {"n_estimators": 3, "random_state": 42}

     # Model tags for MLflow
     model_tags = {
         "project_name": "grocery-forecasting",
         "store_dept": "produce",
         "team": "stores-ml",
         "project_quarter": "Q3-2023"
     }

     # Log MLflow entities
     with mlflow.start_run() as run:
         # Train the model
         model = RandomForestRegressor(**params).fit(X, y)

         # Infer the model signature
         signature = infer_signature(X, model.predict(X))

         # Log parameters and the model
         mlflow.log_params(params)
         mlflow.sklearn.log_model(model, artifact_path="sklearn-model", signature=signature)

         # Register the model with tags
         model_uri = f"runs:/{run.info.run_id}/sklearn-model"
         model_version = mlflow.register_model(model_uri, "RandomForestRegressionModel", tags=model_tags)

         # Output model registration details
         print(f"Model Name: {model_version.name}")
         print(f"Model Version: {model_version.version}")
     ```

2. **Compare and Filter Machine Learning Models**:
   - Use MLflow to search among multiple models saved within the workspace:
     ```python
     from pprint import pprint
     from mlflow.tracking import MlflowClient

     client = MlflowClient()
     for rm in client.list_registered_models():
         pprint(dict(rm), indent=4)
     ```
