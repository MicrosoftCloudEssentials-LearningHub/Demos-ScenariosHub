          - langchain.openai==0.2.4
    ```

### Configure Azure OpenAI Service
1. **Set Up API Keys**: Ensure you have the API key and endpoint URL for your deployed model. Set these as environment variables

     <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1639cf55-772f-42e3-8da6-1f110d2dc9fe">

     ```python
     import os

     # Set the API key for Azure OpenAI
     os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your_openai_api_key"

     # Set the base URL for the Azure OpenAI service
     os.environ["OPENAI_API_BASE"] = "https://your_openai_api_base/"

     # Set the API version for the Azure OpenAI service
     os.environ["OPENAI_API_VERSION"] = "2022-12-01"

     # Set the API type for the Azure OpenAI service
     os.environ["OPENAI_API_TYPE"] = "azure"
     ```

2. **Initialize Azure OpenAI Class**: Create an instance of the Azure OpenAI class using the environment variables set above.

    <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b1b03f7a-3dfd-402b-90c3-56ff73b83fce">

     ```python
    from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
    
    # Create an instance of the Azure OpenAI class
    llm = ChatOpenAI(
        model_kwargs={
            "deployment_name": "your-deployment-name",
            "model_name": "your-model-name",
            "api_key": "your-api-key"
        },
        temperature=0,
        verbose=True
    )
     ```

3. **Call the Deployed Model**: Use the Azure OpenAI service to generate text or perform other language model tasks. Here's an example of generating a response based on a prompt
     ```python
    # Define a prompt
    prompt = "Once upon a time"
    
    # Generate a response from the Azure OpenAI service using the invoke method
    response = llm.invoke(prompt)
    
    # Print the response
    print(response)
     ```

Make sure to replace `"your_openai_api_key"`, `"https://your_openai_api_base/"`, `"your_deployment_name"`, and `"your_model_name"` with your actual API key, base URL, deployment name, and model name from your Azure OpenAI instance. This example demonstrates how to configure and use an existing Azure OpenAI instance in Microsoft Fabric. 

### Step 4: Basic Usage of LangChain Transformer
1. **Create a Prompt Template**:
   - Define a prompt template for generating definitions:
     ```python
     from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate

     copy_prompt = PromptTemplate(
         input_variables=["technology"],
         template="Define the following word: {technology}",
     )
     ```

2. **Set Up an LLMChain**:
   - Create an LLMChain with the defined prompt template:
     ```python
     from langchain.chains import LLMChain

     chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=copy_prompt)
     ```

3. **Configure LangChain Transformer**:
   - Set up the LangChain transformer to execute the processing chain:
     ```python
     from synapse.ml.cognitive.langchain import LangchainTransformer

     transformer = (
         LangchainTransformer()
         .setInputCol("technology")
         .setOutputCol("definition")
         .setChain(chain)
         .setSubscriptionKey(openai_api_key)
         .setUrl(openai_api_base)
     )
     ```

4. **Create a Test DataFrame**:
   - Construct a DataFrame with technology names:
     ```python
     df = spark.createDataFrame(
         [(0, "docker"), (1, "spark"), (2, "python")],
         ["label", "technology"]
     )
     display(transformer.transform(df))
     ```

### Step 5: Using LangChain for Large Scale Literature Review
1. **Define Functions for Content Extraction and Prompt Generation**:
   - Extract content from PDFs linked in arXiv papers and generate prompts for extracting specific information:
     ```python
     from langchain.document_loaders import OnlinePDFLoader

     def paper_content_extraction(inputs: dict) -> dict:
         arxiv_link = inputs["arxiv_link"]
         loader = OnlinePDFLoader(arxiv_link)
         pages = loader.load_and_split()
         return {"paper_content": pages[0].page_content + pages[1].page_content}

     def prompt_generation(inputs: dict) -> dict:
         output = inputs["Output"]
         prompt = (
             "find the paper title, author, summary in the paper description below, output them. "
             "After that, Use websearch to find out 3 recent papers of the first author in the author section below "
             "(first author is the first name separated by comma) and list the paper titles in bullet points: "
             "<Paper Description Start>\n" + output + "<Paper Description End>."
         )
         return {"prompt": prompt}
     ```

2. **Create a Sequential Chain for Information Extraction**:
   - Set up a chain to extract structured information from an arXiv link:
     ```python
     from langchain.chains import TransformChain, SimpleSequentialChain

     paper_content_extraction_chain = TransformChain(
         input_variables=["arxiv_link"],
         output_variables=["paper_content"],
         transform=paper_content_extraction,
         verbose=False,
     )

     paper_summarizer_template = """
     You are a paper summarizer, given the paper content, it is your job to summarize the paper into a short summary, 
     and extract authors and paper title from the paper content.
     """
     ```

### Step 6: Machine Learning Integration with Microsoft Fabric
1. **Train and Register Machine Learning Models**:
   - Use Microsoft Fabric's native integration with the MLflow framework to log the trained machine learning models, the used hyperparameters, and evaluation metrics:
     ```python
     import mlflow
     from mlflow.models import infer_signature
     from sklearn.datasets import make_regression
     from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

     # Generate synthetic regression data
     X, y = make_regression(n_features=4, n_informative=2, random_state=0, shuffle=False)

     # Model parameters
     params = {"n_estimators": 3, "random_state": 42}

     # Model tags for MLflow
     model_tags = {
         "project_name": "grocery-forecasting",
         "store_dept": "produce",
         "team": "stores-ml",
         "project_quarter": "Q3-2023"
     }

     # Log MLflow entities
     with mlflow.start_run() as run:
         # Train the model
         model = RandomForestRegressor(**params).fit(X, y)

         # Infer the model signature
         signature = infer_signature(X, model.predict(X))

         # Log parameters and the model
         mlflow.log_params(params)
         mlflow.sklearn.log_model(model, artifact_path="sklearn-model", signature=signature)

         # Register the model with tags
         model_uri = f"runs:/{run.info.run_id}/sklearn-model"
         model_version = mlflow.register_model(model_uri, "RandomForestRegressionModel", tags=model_tags)

         # Output model registration details
         print(f"Model Name: {model_version.name}")
         print(f"Model Version: {model_version.version}")
     ```

2. **Compare and Filter Machine Learning Models**:
   - Use MLflow to search among multiple models saved within the workspace:
     ```python
     from pprint import pprint
     from mlflow.tracking import MlflowClient

     client = MlflowClient()
     for rm in client.list_registered_models():
         pprint(dict(rm), indent=4)
     ```
