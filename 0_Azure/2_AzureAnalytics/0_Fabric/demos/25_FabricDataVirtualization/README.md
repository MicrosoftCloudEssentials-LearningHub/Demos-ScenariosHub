----------

Data Virtualization can be leveraged either through a dedicated tool or an integrated approach:

> `Dedicated Tool`: Traditional data virtualization tools (e.g., Denodo, Informatica, etc) are specifically designed for data virtualization. <br/>
> `Integrated Approach`: Microsoft Fabric provides data virtualization capabilities by integrating a range of services, each specializing in areas such as data integration (Azure Data Factory), storage (Data Lake Storage), querying (Azure Synapse Analytics), and visualization (Power Bi).

## What is Data Virtualization?

> Data virtualization is a data management approach that `allows applications to retrieve and manipulate data without needing to know the technical details about the data, such as its format or physical location`.
> Is `commonly used in business intelligence, service-oriented architecture, cloud computing, and master data management`. It helps organizations `make data-driven decisions by providing a comprehensive and up-to-date view of their data`.

###  Key Features & Fabric Components

| Key Features | Fabric Component |
| --- | --- |
| **Unified Data Access**: Provides a single access layer for data from multiple sources, such as databases, data warehouses, and cloud services | - **OneLake**: Acts as a unified data lake, enabling seamless access to data from various sources. Centralizes data storage, making it easier to access and manage data from different sources. <br/> - **Azure Synapse Analytics**: Allows querying across different data sources without moving the data, providing a virtualized view. Offers a unified analytics platform that integrates big data and data warehousing, allowing for seamless data querying and analysis. |
| **Real-Time Data Integration**: Allows real-time access to data without moving it from its original location | - **Shortcuts and Mirroring (Data Factory)**: Facilitate real-time data integration and transformation, allowing you to work with data in its original location. <br/> - **Real-Time Intelligence**: Supports real-time analytics and insights, enhancing decision-making processes. <br/> - **Azure Stream Analytics**: Processes real-time data streams for immediate insights. Provides real-time data processing capabilities, enabling you to analyze data as it arrives. |
| **Flexibility and Efficiency**: Users can access and combine data quickly and cost-effectively, accelerating data delivery and decision-making | **Microsoft Fabric**: Provides a comprehensive data management and analytics solution. <br/> - **Power BI**: Connects to various data sources to create interactive reports and dashboards, enhancing data-driven decision-making. Enhances data visualization and reporting, allowing users to create interactive and insightful dashboards. <br/> - **Azure Data Factory**: Enables flexible data integration and transformation workflows. |
