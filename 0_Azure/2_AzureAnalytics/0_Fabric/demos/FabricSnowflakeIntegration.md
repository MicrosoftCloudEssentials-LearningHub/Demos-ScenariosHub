Here are some key points and new features you can highlight:

## Microsoft Fabric for Power BI
1. **Copilot Integration**: Power BI now includes Copilot, which uses generative AI to help create reports and analyze data by simply describing the insights you need.
2. **Unified Platform**: Fabric brings together Power BI, Azure Synapse, and Azure Data Factory into one unified SaaS platform, making it easier for different roles to collaborate.
3. **Enhanced Data Integration**: With Data Factory in Fabric, you can unify hybrid and multicloud data estates, combining the ease of Power Query with the power of Data Factory.
4. **New Visualization Features**: Power BI has added new formatting capabilities, including dark mode support and improved visual calculations.

## Microsoft Fabric for Azure Data Factory (ADF)
1. **Data Integration**: Fabric Data Factory offers new connectors, including those for Oracle, MySQL, Google BigQuery, and Snowflake, enhancing data integration and transformation capabilities.
2. **Simplified Data Pipelines**: The new Data Factory in Fabric integrates better with the unified data platform, including Lakehouse and Data Warehouse, making data pipelines more efficient.
3. **Real-Time Data Replication**: Mirroring in Fabric allows for near real-time replication of data from various sources into OneLake, simplifying data management and analytics.

## Impact on Snowflake Usage
1. **Mirroring**: Fabric's Mirroring feature allows you to replicate data from Snowflake into OneLake in near real-time, reducing the need for complex ETL pipelines.
2. **Unified Analytics**: With data mirrored into OneLake, you can leverage Fabric's analytics tools, such as Spark, notebooks, and Power BI, to analyze and visualize data seamlessly.
3. **Cost and Latency**: Mirroring provides a low-cost and low-latency solution for data replication, making it easier to keep your data up-to-date and accessible for analytics.
