Azure Data Storage provides scalable, secure, and accessible cloud storage, ideal for big data and analytics, with various storage tiers. It supports a wide range of services and tools. Azure also offers relational and non-relational databases, with built-in management for high availability and performance, catering to different application needs.

## Differences between Azure Data Storage and Databases

Azure Data Storage and Databases both persist data but are optimized for different purposes. Storage provides durable capacity while databases structure data for efficient access. Storage suits long-term file retention while databases enable interactive applications.

| Storage | Database |
| --- | --- |
| Storage provides raw data capacity | It is structured for efficient querying and analysis |
| Data is opaque to storage system | Database has schema and metadata to represent data |
| Address data blocks through locations | Database uses abstractions like tables, documents |
| Enterprise storage connects to servers | Databases are accessed by clients |
| Durable long-term retention | Temporary persistence tier |
