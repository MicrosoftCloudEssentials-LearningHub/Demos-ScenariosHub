Each method has its own strengths and use cases, so the best alternative depends on your specific requirements for security, cost, and ease of use:

| Connection Method                                | Description                                                                 | Security Level       | Cost Estimate (Monthly) | Can Be Used Instead Of                                                      | Why Can Be Used Instead Of                                                  | Can Be Integrated With                                                      | Why Can Be Integrated With                                                  |
