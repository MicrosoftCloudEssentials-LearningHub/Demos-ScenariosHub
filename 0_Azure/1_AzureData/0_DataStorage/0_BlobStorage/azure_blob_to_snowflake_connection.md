|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|
| **Azure Private Link**                           | Provides private connectivity, keeping traffic within the Azure network.    | Very High            | High                    |
| **Storage Integration with Azure Service Principal** | Uses Snowflake storage integration for secure authentication.               | High                 | Medium                  |
| **Azure Data Factory (ADF)**                     | Securely transfers data using managed identities.                           | High                 | Medium                  |
| **Snowpipe with Azure Event Grid**               | Automates data ingestion with secure configurations.                        | Medium to High       | Medium                  |
| **Shared Access Signature (SAS) Token**          | Provides limited access to storage resources.                               | Medium               | Low                     |
| **Direct Credentials**                           | Uses storage account keys or access keys.                                   | Low                  | Low                     |
| **Firewall Settings and Whitelisting IP Ranges** | Additional security measures to restrict access and enhance security.       | Medium to High       | Low to Medium           |

> Applying firewall settings and whitelisting IP ranges enhances security by restricting access, though they aren't direct connection methods.
